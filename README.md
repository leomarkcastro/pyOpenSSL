# pyOpenSSL
School project where the aim is to use openssl by accessing it on a programming language

This program implements the following algorithms

- aes
- sha
- rsa
- ecdsa

To run this program, first, install openssl and make sure you can run openssl in your command prompt by typing 'openssl'
  - In case you haven't installed openssl on windows, you can download an installer in this site. -> https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

After you installed OpenSSL on your computer, you can run the app in two ways:
  - If you want to run the python as is, you should add "C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin" on the path variables on your PC's environment variables -> https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/
  - Else, you can run my app from the get go just by running "run.bat" [given that your computer won't see that bat file as a virus]
